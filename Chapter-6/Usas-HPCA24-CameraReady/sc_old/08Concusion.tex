The growth of smart cities and urban mobility applications, along with reformations in privacy laws, have produced a need for pervasive, DNN based continuous learning at the edge. Although current commercial devices are capable of handling inference at the edge, the power and resource requirements of training make it impractical and unsustainable for all edge nodes to also perform continuous training off of grid power. In this work, we design $\USS$, a sustainable continuous learning platform, which can perform video analytics by using an intermittent power source like solar power. The learning algorithm of $\USS$ delivers 4.96\% more accurate classification compared to a na\"ive learner, and the morphable hardware design uses intermittent computing to maintain forward progress even while running on lower power budget. Together, $\USS$ can save up to 200lbs of $CO_2$ per year compared to a state of the art accelerator running on the grid.% In this throughput dominated age, we believe that, $\USS$, as its name suggests, will show path towards a sustainability-first design paradigm.
