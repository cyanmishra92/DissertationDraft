As systems utilizing energy harvesting edge devices are tasked with increasingly complex tasks, like HAR or predictive maintenance, both system and node designs must respond with targeted efficiency-maximizing optimizations. Our proposal, \emph{Seeker}, synergizes EH sensor nodes host devices by intelligently distributing computations among them, while significantly minimizing the communication overheads. Our experiments show that, by leveraging coreset techniques in data reduction and tuning these techniques for application-aware properties, \emph{Seeker} can reduce the communication overhead by $\approx 8.9\times$, while providing better accuracy ($86.8\%$), even when limited to harvested power, than state-of-the-art energy-optimized DNNs running on a fully powered device ($81.2\%$). Furthermore, it also outperforms the state of the art system designed specifically for EH-WSNs. Collectively, the optimizations in \emph{Seeker}  reduce communication traffic, while improving inference accuracy, demonstrating the potential of holistic system/node/application optimization for the current and future generation of (energy harvesting) wireless sensor nodes.
