Energy-harvesting wireless sensor networks (EH-WSNs) offer sustainable solutions for large-scale IoT deployments but face challenges due to the unreliability and intermittent availability of individual sensors. We propose a comprehensive framework that integrates a game-theoretic participation strategy with a federated learning approach tailored for EH-WSNs. Our game-theoretic model enables sensors to make optimal participation decisions based on energy levels, data quality, and collective inference impact, fostering cooperative behavior while managing individual energy constraints. The federated learning framework accommodates intermittent participation and variable data quality, ensuring robust model training despite sensor unreliability. Simulation results demonstrate that our integrated approach significantly enhances inference accuracy and energy efficiency compared to traditional participation strategies.
